Hi there 👋 Phil McRakin here just getting settled into the neighborhood.

Bashify@Bash-Life Public Repo, Featuring Bash Snippets, Scripts, Shell resources and other BS.
You can correct, edit and improve any of these shody shell scripts!

I'll add to this soon, just getting things setup, but I hope to fill this up with a nice collection of Bash tools.

🍿 Fun fact -This repo sucks lol.

🧙 Alright Check back soon.
